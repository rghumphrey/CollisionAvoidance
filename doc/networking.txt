To configure the networking for both Rapsberry Pi's, follow this guide:

https://raspberrypi-guide.github.io/networking/create-wireless-access-point

Follow this guide until the "Enable routing and IP masquerading" section. This only needs to be done on one Raspberry Pi. Instead of having YOURSSID and YOURPWD in the configuration file, you can put any ssid and pwd, for instance droneNetwork and dronePassword.

To ensure this hotspot starts on boot, create a file in /etc/systemd/system. For example, run this command:

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/start_hotspot.service

Then include this in the file: 

[Unit]
Description=Custom Wi-Fi setup at boot
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/nmcli dev set wlan0 managed no
ExecStartPost=/bin/systemctl restart hostapd
ExecStartPost=/bin/systemctl restart dnsmasq
RemainAfterExit=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

After doing this, run this to create and enable the service:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable start_hotspot.service

This should now configure the Raspberry Pi to start hotspot on launch. To configure the other Raspberry pi, you have to edit the wpa_supplicant.conf file. Run this:

sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

Then change the code to be like this (assuming droneNetwork and dronePassword are your ssid and pwd:

country=US   # (or your country code)
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid="droneNetwork"
    psk="dronePassword"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}

You then have to configure the static IP by editing the wlan0.network service: 

sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/network
sudo nano /etc/systemd/network/wlan0.network

Then edit this to look like this:

[Match]
Name=wlan0

[Network]
Address=192.168.4.10/24
Gateway=192.168.4.1
DNS=8.8.8.8

Make sure this IP address is in the same subnet you set on the other Raspberry Pi. 

Then restart and make sure the service is on:

sudo systemctl enable wpa_supplicant@wlan0
sudo systemctl enable systemd-networkd
sudo systemctl start systemd-networkd
sudo reboot
