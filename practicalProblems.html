    <li>
      <p><strong>SITL Setup:</strong> One of our first initial challenges was setting up our SITL instance to work
      with two drones. After reinstalling SITL several times, we learned that to run two drones you had to use sim_vehicle.py
      instead of mavproxy.py, and add --instance=1 and --sysid=2 flags to the command to get the SITL to properly initialize.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <p><strong>Socket Communication:</strong> When setting up our communication, we were trying to use one port for our UDP
      communcation. We wanted to do this for abstraction and simplicity, but quickly found the receiving to be challenging without
      proper port initialization. After many different approaches, we were finally able to get the socket properly set up so that
      many drones were able to all send and receive over the same socket.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <p><strong>Connectivity in the field:</strong> When we were in the field and trying to make adjustments, we were having very 
      long      delays due to the poor hotspot connection provided by out drone. Since we were using our own hotspot created by the 
      Raspberry Pi,       it took very long to edit files on the drones. We were also only able to edit via SSH/nano because the 
      connection was too poor to      run any other type of editor, and even nano crashed the SSH connection several times. It took 
      about 10-20 minutes to edit our code      on the drone that was a client on the hotspot. We realized by the end that we simply 
      had to bring the drones closer together to make editing much faster.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><strong>Absolute vs Relative Global Positioning:</strong> During demo, we quickly realized we had issues with our
      positioning and mission planning. Our code had worked perfectly in SITL, so debugging was challenging. Eventually we realized
      that our altitude had been setting to 30 ft when in reality we wanted it to be 350. This was because our actual global position
      was 350, and we were using relative to set the position, which meant we were telling the drone to move very far down. This problem
      arose because in the SITL, our base altitude was 0, instead of 330 which it was in the field. This issue persisted after many
      adjustments but we were eventually able to fix all of the positions.</p>
    </li>

    
  </ul>
  <p><em>Advice for next year's students:</em> The best advice we could give is to test as soon as possible to ensure that you are able
  to have multiple days in the field. If you are doing a project similar to this, you can also do a lot of testing with the networking
  before by only using the Raspberry Pi's. Get the code on the hardware as quickly as possible and write very simple scripts to test 
  each different function so that debugging is very quick.</p>
